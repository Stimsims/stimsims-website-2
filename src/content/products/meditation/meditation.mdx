# Stem Meditation
Research indicates brain waves have an impact on learning and memory function. I am currently making a series of physics focused meditations that visualize fundamental natural phenomena. This series is targeted at students taking year 10 physics that involve atoms, radiation, photons and subsequent technologies.

## Curiosities Inspired
Colin: "The sun loses 4 billion kilos per second? How does light go from weighing something to not weighing something?"
Holly: "How do the little x-rays that come out of the iodine atoms not mess up the actual x-ray image?"



### Why Make Meditations About Physics?
This project was inspired by appreciation for the power of meditation. I love guided meditations, but was surprised to find no
meditations that focused attention on the sciences. As I see the beauty in the tiniest quantum of the universe, I decided to 
make these meditations in the hopes of bringing the soothing power of meditation to any who have yet to fall in love with 
the universe at the atomic scale.
