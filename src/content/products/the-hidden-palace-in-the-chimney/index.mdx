<h5>A Social Game Book for Children:</h5>

<div class="text-left">
  <ul>
    <li>For extra wriggly children who need more support to stay focused</li>
    <li>Movement as choice - the kids develop kinaesthetic skills</li>
    <li>Repetition with loops - if the children miss the queue, they'll be surprised to learn the book changes! Children get as many repeats as they need, progressing at their pace.</li>
    <li>Socialise - this book can be read to open or more children. The more the merrier!</li>
    <li>The children interact with a colorful cast of palace attendants, including a racoon butler, a dragon chef and a unicorn ladies maid. They each test the children to ensure they're fit to meet their queen. If the children don't rise to the challenge, back to the start they go.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Back Story</h5>
  <p>During story time with my nephews and their friends, I noticed many kids need a little more interaction and attention to stay focused. Tired of nagging them,
  I wished there were books that made the interaction part of the story!</p>
  <p>This is an interactive, social game book. It's designed for kids aged 3 to 5 who love to move. 
  The reader narrates the story while children act out their choices - stomping, spinning or bowing their way through the adventure.
  If they don't get it right the first time, that's okay! They'll find themselves in a loop, meeting the same characters with the same challenges again.
  Repetition is fantastic at this age. Another go could be just what they need to hear the important information and solve the puzzle.</p>
