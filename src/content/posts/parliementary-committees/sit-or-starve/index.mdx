but, as I say, there are mixed results. It is not a measure that can easily achieve that, because
you do get a small spike in attendance. The issue is: how sustainable is it?
What we have found is that where the attendance does increase after an intervention, if a
social worker is engaged with that family the attendance will stay up a bit higher for a bit
longer.
