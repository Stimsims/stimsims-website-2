When kids have the opportunity to draw about their interests in class, a [popular image](#data) that appears is the blue hedgehog, drawn lovingly with varying degrees of skill. Sonic enjoys rent-free living on children's school bags, their pencil cases and even their socks peeking out under their rolled up school pants. Sonics antics are avidly shared and discussed by his fans during snack time, building a vocabulary around his thoughts, actions and weaknesses.
<br />
When a child discusses their favourite character, a lot more information is available than the excited surface chatter implies. In Jungian terms, a child's favourite character and the archetypes they play show what the child considers
interesting and useful. The stories are models of social truisms and habits they're growing an understanding of. 
<br />

In addition to being a fun topic of conversation that children enjoy sharing, these characters and their stories provide important sites of understanding and intrigue to connect new information to. Below is an overview of the many roles Sonic has played over the years. Some of his archetypal roles were more prominent in the 90s Adventure of Sonic cartoon, while other themes expanded during the 2010s Sonic Boom series. 
I used Carl Jung's works and the AI large language models Llama3.3 and Deepseek-r1 to fish out examples of the following archetypes (you can [read more about the data here](#data)):
- [Hero](#hero)
- [Shadow](#shadow)
- [Rebel](#rebel)
- [Trickster](#trickster)
- [Child](#child)
- [Sage](#sage)
- [Creator](#creator)

**Balance between Heroism and Self-Preservation**: Sonic often struggles with balancing his heroic instincts with self-preservation, leading to conflicts and character growth.

##### 2010's Sonic Boom
Neither Llama3.3 nor Deepseek were able to find quality examples. It appears they both found anti-examples of the archetype.

Llama 3.3's Archetypal Analysis
 - **Episode 1**: Sonic's behavior is driven by his desire for revenge rather than a noble cause, raising questions about his moral compass.
 - **Episode 2**: Sonic stops fighting when Knuckles launches an attack, showing a lack of courage and selflessness.
 - **Episode 3**: Sonic's impulsive and reckless behavior towards Mark raises concerns about his moral compass.
 - **Episode 4**: Sonic's inability to take charge and lead is highlighted by his ineffectiveness in stopping Dr. Eggman.

Complexes and Transformations
 - **Inability to take charge**: Sonic struggles to lead his friends and rally them in times of need.
 - **Impulsive behavior**: Sonic often acts on instinct without thinking through the consequences, leading to reckless decisions.
 - **Lack of selflessness**: Sonic's actions are sometimes driven by personal interests rather than a desire to help others.

## <a name="shadow">Shadow Archetype</a>

### 90's Adventures of Sonic
 - "You know, Botsy, you really are a sore loser!" - Sonic's use of this phrase to mock Robotnik implies a sense of self-awareness and acceptance of his own flaws.
 - "You're just gonna get so bored with that same old routine. You need to mix it up, be more exciting, take risks!" - suggests that he is aware of his own darker impulses and is trying to overcome them.

#### Complexes and Transformations
Conflict between confidence and insecurity: Sonic often displays confidence in his abilities, but also struggles with self-doubt.

### 2010's Sonic Boom

The episode highlights Sonic's struggle with responsibility and selflessness, as he initially fails to handle the situation adequately but eventually steps up.
 - **Llama3.3: In "Spacemageddonocalypse_Transcript"**, the group discovers that Eggman sent back pictures of Knuckles landing on the asteroid.

"You know, I've got some great ideas for new burgers. Sonic knows what people want, and they want it hot." 
 - **Deepseek: "Spacemageddonocalypse_Transcript"**: Sonic rushes off to Meh Burger when faced with the asteroid debris instead of addressing the problem directly. This behavior reflects a lack of heroism and avoidance of difficult tasks, aligning with the shadow archetype's traits. "You know, I've got some great ideas for new burgers. Sonic knows what people want, and they want it hot." – Highlights his self-centeredness.
 - **Llama3.3: In "Inn_Sanity_Transcript"**, Dr. Eggman's plan to destroy the city is foiled by Team Sonic. However, Sonic soon becomes distracted from the situation and leaves.
 - Llama3.3: Sonic's responses to criticism or praise suggest that he is struggling with feelings of inadequacy and insecurity, as seen in "The_Biggest_Fan_Transcript" where he responds positively to Tails' suggestion that his supposed heroic actions in space are obvious. "'A true hero never gives up!' Uh, did they not see me saving the world just now?" (The Biggest Fan Transcript)

#### Complexes and Transformations
Sonic's journey involves overcoming his fear of responsibility and desire for recognition. Over time, he learns to balance his self-interest with the needs of the group, demonstrating growth from shadow archetype traits towards a more integrated personality.

- "Sonic: Pillow fight!" – Exemplifies his playful nature.

#### Anti-Archetypal Examples
- Sonic inconsistently represents the Child archetype due to a mix of childlike traits and rebellious qualities. His innocence and curiosity align with the Child archetype, while his tendency to rely on others sometimes contrasts with traditional characteristics.

#### Complexes and Transformations
This dynamic evolution highlights how Sonic embodies the sage archetype through overcoming obstacles and evolving into a more mature guide.

<hr class="vertical-padding-100 top-divider" />



## <a name="creator">Creator Archetype</a>
The creator archetype traditionally represents a character who creates or brings into being something new and original. This archetype often embodies a sense of innovation, progress, and mastery.

All LLM's seemed more interested in how Dr. Robotnik/Eggman was a better example of the creator archetype. 

### 90's Adventures of Sonic
No examples found

### 2010's Sonic Boom
* In **"Mombot_(episode)Transcript"**, Sonic is the one who created Mombot, and Dr. Eggman tries to undermine her independence and assertiveness. "You created you. I'm your father. I'm your son. Your father and your son!" - "Mombot_(episode)_Transcript".
* In **"Multi-Tails_Transcript"**, Sonic and friends travel through the air using Eggman's Eggmobile, showcasing a creative solution to a problem.

#### Deepseeks Thought Chain
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how Sonic represents different Jungian archetypes... I notice that in each entry, Dr. Eggman is identified as embodying the creator archetype with varying confidence levels: two entries have a confidence of 5, and one has a lower confidence of 1. This suggests that while he's often seen as a creator... Looking at the quotes, Dr. Eggman often uses lines that reflect his manipulative and controlling nature.

<Image class="post-image" class="post-image width-500" width={500}  src={trends} alt="google trends graph comparing search volume for Sonic, Mario, Harry Potter, Barbie and Pokemon. Pokemon is the most popular with large spikes, Sonic is steady with respectable middeling numbers." />
## Popularity
The Sonic franchise is a highly valuable media empire with an [estiamted $15 billion](https://vgsales.fandom.com/wiki/Sonic) in revenue across media types. This is attributed to $9 billion in video game sales, and $6 billion in multimedia stories including tv-shows and comic books.

## Data Analysis
This analysis is based on the [excellent transcripts](https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Sonic_Boom_transcripts) made by Sonic's fanbase. 

I used Carl Jung's archetypes to fish the following summaries out of the Sonic transcripts. 

##### Side Note About Large Language Models Used
I used Llama 3.2 for quick summaries of individual episodes. I then tried both Llama3.3 and Deepseek to analyise the summaries. Overall, Llama3.3 found better examples, but Deepseek r1 32b added an additional layer of analysis occasionally called 'anti-archetypal examples'.
