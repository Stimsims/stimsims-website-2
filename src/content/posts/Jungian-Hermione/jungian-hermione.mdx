# Why Do Fans Love Hermione?
As plants are drawn to the sun, so too are people's minds drawn to their favourite thoughts in those scant hours between work and sleep.
Hermione Granger is a popular witch from the Harry Potter series who has maintained a strong fanbase that continue to create are and stories exploring her character. 
Why does she live rent free in so many people's minds? To explore this question I've gathered a few bits of data available on the internet that reveal some common themes that are solar power to her fans thoughts.

## Who Is Hermione?
<Image class="post-image width-300" width={300} src={cover} alt="word cloud of stories summaries that have hermione/ron in them"/>
At websites like [Archive of Our Own](https://archiveofourown.org/), fans share stories about characters they love. There's a wide variety of stories, but they're often centred around character relationships. 
I decided to gather the summaries of some stories for her most common relationships and analyse them with Carl Jung's archetypes and a little AI on my computer:
- [Hermione/Ron - the Mentor and the Mum](#ron)
- [Hermione/Harry - The Teacher and the Hero](#harry)
- [Hermione/Draco - The Care Giver and the Trickster/Outsider](#draco)
- [Hermione/Snape - The Anima Hero and the Mentor Shadow](#snape)
- [Hermione/Tom Riddle - The Hero and the Shadow](#tom)

## What Do Fans Say About Her?
https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/9h5o1g/why_does_everyone_love_hermione_granger_so_much/
[Whitetiger844](https://www.reddit.com/user/Whitetiger844/): "I like her. She's got flaws for sure, but I always liked that she was never one of those useless female characters who follows the guys around and does nothing but get in the way, and depend on them to do everything. Hermione is rude and irritating at times, but at least she's useful and respectable."
[enlitenme](https://www.reddit.com/user/enlitenme/): "I used to find her annoying! Lately I'm starting to appreciate her role. Maybe I am more like the know-it-all perfectionist than I thought..."

"Hermione Granger- smart, loyal, brave, kind, the list can go on. I know that many people feel that Hermione is there fictional role model, including me of course"

"I was a little bit in love with her... **She’s smart, funny, brave, and looks cool in every situation**... I wanted to know everything about her — what she liked, what she hated, what books she read, and what spells she mastered."


## An Attempt at a Jungian Analysis with AI 
This is a curated list of observations made by different ollama models about Hermione as she's depicted by fans. I asked some local ollama models to have a go at a Jungian analysis of Hermione and her role in some of her most common relationships. Some of the models even succeeded in using Jungian vocabulary. 

**Data:** I randomly selected a few dozen stories from the Archive of Our Own Harry Potter fandom. Word clouds are based on the summaries. The ollama models used the full text for character analysis. I primarily used Llama3.3:70b, but samantha-mistral and phi3.5 also came in handy.

### <a name="ron">Hermione/Ron - the Mentor and the Mum</a>
<Image class="post-image" src={hermione_ron} alt="word cloud of stories summaries that have hermione/ron in them" loading="lazy"/>
This analysis was limited as the Hermione/Ron relationship tended to be a background relationship. They were supports for the central characters transformations, usually Harry.

#### Archetype
The following archetypes can be identified in the characters:
* **Hermione**: The Scholar/Mentor archetype, representing knowledge, wisdom, and guidance.
* **Ron**: The Mom Friend/Nurturer archetype, embodying care, empathy, and protection. There are instances where Ron tries to mediate between Harry and Hermione, particularly when Hermione becomes overly focused on Harry's magical education.

#### Complexes
The interaction between Hermione's **Anima/Mother** archetypes and Ron's **Nurturer** archetypes could evoke several complexes:
- **Intellectual Superiority Complex**: Hermione's intelligence and quick thinking could evoke feelings of inadequacy or an intellectual superiority complex in Ron, leading to defensive behaviours.

### <a name="harry">Hermione/Harry - The Teacher and the Hero</a>
<Image class="post-image" src={hermione_slash_harry} alt="word cloud of stories summaries that have hermione/ron in them" loading="lazy"/>
#### Archetype
The archetypes that emerge in this context are:
* The **Hero** (Harry): representing the courageous, adventurous, and self-sacrificing aspects of his own psyche
* The Teacher (Hermione): Their interaction also suggests the presence of the **Teacher-Student** archetype, with Hermione taking on a teaching role and Harry assuming a learning role.

#### Complexes
The complexes that emerge in this context are:
* Hermione's **Need for Control**: her desire to correct Harry and assert her intellectual superiority

#### Transformation
As Hermione and Harry interact, their complexes begin to transform:
* Hermione's need for control is balanced by her willingness to learn and explore new ideas with Harry
* Harry's fear of vulnerability is replaced by his trust in Hermione and his willingness to learn from her

And a wordcloud for their friendship focused fics:

### <a name="draco">Hermione/Draco - The Care Giver and the Trickster</a>
<Image class="post-image" src={hermione_slash_draco} alt="word cloud of stories summaries that have hermione/ron in them" loading="lazy"/>
#### Archetype
- The Care Giver (Hermione): with her nurturing and empathetic nature.  Her intellectual curiosity and determination represent the active, logical aspects of the Anima (feminine aspect of psyche), while her emotional struggles and relationships with others (such as Malfoy) represent the more intuitive, emotional aspects. 
- The Outsider (Draco): with his complexity and intensity, may represent the archetype of the Outsider or the Rebel, challenging Hermione's perceptions and pushing her to grow.
- The Trickster (Draco): playfully testing boundaries and pushing Hermione out of her comfort zone.

#### Complexes
Hermione's relationship with Malfoy can be seen as a representation of the complex of opposites. Malfoy's words and actions trigger a strong reaction in Hermione, suggesting that he represents a part of herself that she is not fully aware of or comfortable with. The tension between them may symbolize the conflict between Hermione's rational and emotional selves.

#### Transformation
The integration of Hermione's transformation into consciousness is represented by her growing self-awareness and acceptance of her own emotions and intuition. Her relationships with others, particularly Malfoy, serve as a catalyst for this integration, forcing her to confront and reconcile the different aspects of her psyche.

A word cloud for their friendship focused fics (I love that 'want' is their key word!):

### <a name="snape">Hermione/Snape - The Anima Hero and the Mentor Shadow</a>
Warning - this fandom area appears to depict age-gaps and underage themes. 
<Image class="post-image" src={hermione_snape} alt="word cloud of stories summaries that have hermione/ron in them" loading="lazy"/>
#### Archetypes
- The Hero (Hermione): She embodies the **Heroine** archetype, characterized by courage, determination, and a strong sense of justice.
- The Anima (Hermione): Symbolizing the feminine principle of receptivity, nurturing, and intuition.
- The Mentor (Snape): Characterized by guidance, wisdom, and a desire to teach and protect.
- The Shadow (Snape): Symbolizing the repressed or hidden aspects of the self. 

#### Complexes
Hermione's complex is centered around her need for control and order, which stems from her upbringing and personality traits

Snape's complex is rooted in his past traumas and emotional scars, leading to a defensive and often harsh exterior. His relationship with Hermione helps him to slowly open up and confront his inner demons.

#### Transformations
Hermione undergoes a transformation from a rigid and controlled individual to someone more emotionally expressive and vulnerable. Her interactions with Snape help her to develop empathy and understanding for others.

Snape's transformation is characterized by a gradual softening of his exterior, revealing a deeper sense of emotional depth and complexity.

### <a name="tom">Hermione/Tom Riddle - The Hero and the Shadow</a>
<Image class="post-image" src={hermione_tom} alt="word cloud of stories summaries that have hermione/ron in them" loading="lazy"/>

- **The Hero (Hermione):** Her journey involves confronting her fears and understanding Tom Riddle's true nature. She embodies wisdom, courage, and the desire for transformation.
- **The Shadow (Tom Riddle - later Lord Voldemort):** Symbolizes the shadow archetype, embodying darkness, power, and the repressed aspects of human nature. His character is driven by a quest for immortality and dominance.

#### Complexes
**Emotional Connection**: Despite the danger he poses, Hermione finds herself intrigued by Tom Riddle, suggesting an attraction or fascination with the unknown or the darker aspects of human nature.

**The Nature of Evil**: Through Tom Riddle's character, the narrative explores the nature of evil, suggesting that it is not just an external force but also an internal possibility within every individual.

#### Symbolism
**Trust and Surrender**: Hermione's decision to trust Tom Riddle and follow his instructions symbolizes the surrender of the ego or the conscious self to the unconscious or the shadow. 

#### Transformation
**Integration of the Shadow**: These stories touch on concepts of integrating one's shadow, a psychological process where an individual acknowledges and accepts their repressed thoughts, feelings, and desires. 

**Transformation and Self-Discovery**: The story hints at the idea of transformation through confrontation with one's fears and the unknown.
